I'm a curious mind exploring the depths of **cybersecurity**, from digital recon to red team tactics. I love dissecting systems, experimenting in my lab, and constantly sharpening my skills.

### 🛡️ Current Focus
- Ethical hacking & offensive security (Kali Linux, Nmap, Evil Twin attacks, etc.)
- Setting up and documenting hands-on labs
- Diving into real-world attack simulations and toolsets
